# README

This repo contains a programming challenge for people who are interested in applying
for a backend developer job at SeQura.  The challenge has been designed to be realistic,
i.e., you will encounter some of the same problems that we have done at SeQura.  It is
however not _real_ or _complete_, i.e. the code is not extracted from our real systems
and the rules described below are not the real ones.

## The code

The code in this repo represents a very simplified view of the data model used in SeQura's
backend.  It contains three models:

* `Merchant`: A merchant is a person or company who has a shop on the internet and offers
	SeQura's payment methods.
* `Order`: Orders are the central object in the day-to-day work at SeQura.  They represent
	a shopper's order in an online store, and they are only present in this system if
	SeQura approved the shopper's request for a short-term credit.

	Order objects can be updated but never deleted.
* `Cart`: A cart represents a list of items such as products, shipment fees, service fees,
	discounts, etc.  Each order has two such lists: one representing the items that have
	been sent and one representing the items that have not yet been sent.  In its role as
	intermediary, SeQura collects payment from the shopper for the value of _both_ carts,
	but only pays the merchant the value of the items that have been shipped.

	Carts are immutable, meaning that cart records in the database never change.  So for instance, when a shopper
	makes a partial return, the corresponding `Order` gets a _new_ `Cart` object in its `shipped_cart`
	slot.  This means that the same `Cart` object can be used in many places without fear of inconsistency.

## The challenge

Every week on Tuesdays, SeQura will pay out money to the merchants in a process called _disbursement_.
The operations manager is now asking you to make
the system calculate _how much_ money should be paid to each merchant based on the following
rules:

1. If an order is included in the disbursement for the first time, we should pay to the merchant
	the value of the shipped cart minus our commission.  (Our commission is 1 % of the order value.)
1. If the value of the shipped cart has changed since last time the order was disbursed, the order should
	be included in the disbursement again.  (The value of the shipped cart changes quite often, sometimes
	because the merchant shipped the second half of an order, and sometimes because the shopper returned
	one or more items.)
1. After a disbursement, SeQura should not owe any money for orders which were shipped _before_ last week
	or earlier.  Orders which were _not_ shipped at the beginning of last week should _not_ be included in
	the disbursement.

You should implement the calculation logic so that it can be launched by a cronjob on a server
using a syntax similar to this:

```bash
rails runner DisbursementBuilder.run_weekly
```

Running this should not produce anything on stdout, but feel free to log what you are doing using
Rails's logger.

The result should be accessible from each merchant's page, so that if you go to `http://localhost:3000/merchants/1`
you should see a list of disbursements, like so:

* Disbursement 2016-03-01
* Disbursement 2016-03-08

Clicking on one of the dates should render a list that can be used by us to know the amount to pay to the merchant
on that day, and a list of the orders (using order numbers) included in this disbursement, so that the merchant can update their books
and feel assured that we have paid them what we owe them.  An example:

```
Disbursement 2016-03-01

O#BBB123	12.34 €
O#BBB125	 2.34 €
O#BBB111	-8.33 €

=total=		 6.35 €
```

### Instructions

1. You are not allowed to _change_ anything that is defined.  Assume that other parts of the system rely on the models looking
	and working like they do.
1. You can add new models as you see fit.
1. You can add attributes to the existing models, but try to keep your solution to your objects.
1. Use meaningful names for models, methods and associations.
1. Avoid calling things "payment" or anything close to that word.  The reason is that we use "payment"
	when we talk about the money that they shopper gives to us, and we want to avoid confusion.
1. You are programming money and the rules are complex.  Automatic tests are absolutely mandatory.  There are some basic tests
	in `/test` already.  Extend them, or use RSpec.
1. In fact, for this challenge, tests or specs are more important than the implementation.  Think of it as two challenges
	that could well be separate:
	1. Transform the business requirements to tests or specs.
	1. Implement a solution according to the specs you created.
1. This is not a school exercise where you focus on solving the problem as stated and ignore everything else.
	You may assume that the data in the system is always correct and consistent, but you must not assume
	that people who use the system do so in the way intended.
	Your solution needs to be technically sound and cover any odd cases that the operations manager might
	not have thought of, just like in real life.  And again: spec (or at least make a note of) the odd
	cases, even if you don't have time to implement them.
1. Don't worry about presentation or visual design.	Readable but ugly is fine.

## Getting started

The code in the repo was developed with Rails 5.0.0beta3 and sqlite3.  There are
a few tests that show how the models work, individually and together.  You should be able
to set up this repo locally for development with these steps:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sequra/disbursement-challenge.git
cd disbursement-challenge
bundle
rails db:migrate
rails test
```

Please do not fork the repo to create your solution.  We don't want a collaboration network of all the people who have taken the challenge.

## Submitting your solution

Once you have solved the challenge, please send an archive of your solution (`.tar.gz` or `.zip`) and include your .git folder.  That way, we can see not only your final solution but also how you arrived there.

If for some reason you want to publish your solution on Github, you are free to do so, but don't do so for the purpose of submitting your solution.
